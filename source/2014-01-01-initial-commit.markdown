# Initial commit!

Since 2005, the Sourcey collective has been developing code and design for private and freelance contracts, as well as our own projects.

The intense workload has left little time for writing and other "social" online activities, so we are extremely excited to publishing a blog which will enable us to share some of the juicy knowledge we have acquired on the path to techno-heaven. 

Sourcey operates around the core idea that open source is not only the future of the internet, but a way of living that mankind must adopt in order to flourish and evolve. To this end we will be unreserved in the giving of our knowledge.

With great knowledge comes power (and hopefully success), and let's not forget responsibility. If you find our publications helpful then share them with your network via your favourite channels. Lets make the world, and the internet, a better place!

Happy coding!

Kam Low, Founder and Lead Developer of Sourcey
