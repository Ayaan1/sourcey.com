The phrase "Web 2.0" coined by Darcy DiNucci back in 1999 to describe web sites that use technology beyond the static pages of earlier web sites. In late 2004 the term was popularised by Tim O'Reilly at the O'Reilly Media Web 2.0 conference. Today, the changes to Google's algorithms have given rise to a new term in the SEO world; "SEO 2.0".

SEO 2.0 is different because the black-hat SEO techniques that worked in the past are no longer an option, unless you desperately want to get your site blacklisted by Google. The new internet is about people, and if Google can find a genuine way to reward integrity and reduce spam, then I'm all for it.

Now that the SEO paradigm has changed, we need to rethink our strategies in 2014. Here are a few key points that you should consider:

1. ### Keep a blog on your company domain
   Google rewards relevant original content now more than ever, so if you know your industry inside out then start writing about it and let Google search become a wonderful source of revenue for your business. [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) is a great blog software that you can install on your web server to get started in no time, or if you have code smarts then check out static website generators live Middleman and Jekyll.

2. ### Syndicate your blog content across your social networks
   Once you have a blog, you will want to share your content across multiple social networks. A great tool to use for this is [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com). Buffer saves you lost of time time by automating and scheduling when your content is published to your social networks.

3. ### Generate social signals and share your content
   So you have published your content to your social networks, but who's sharing it byond your immediate network? In SEO 2.0, social media is playing an increasingly important role in SEO rankings, not to mention customer acquisition. A great tool for generating social signals is the [Gardn](http://gardn.net). Gardn is a network of cool people who will like/share/tweet/+1/pin your content in exchange for the same favour. Using the Gardn will ensure you content is shared across the internet and it reaches as many people as possible.

4. ### Optimise your website
   Page speed and cross device optimization is more important than you think, and it also affects your SEO and rankings. Check out the Google Webmaster tools for an analysis of your website and advice on how to optimise it. If your site analysis ranks poorly then there's a fair change your site is being penalized.

5. ### People
   The new SEO rewards human interaction over creating the greatest SEO link campaign known to man. If you're still trying to do this then maybe you need to rethink what it is you actually stand for. Make friends on the internet and you will be rewarded. The more your potential customers engage on the Internet, the more important it is for you to make friends and foster loyalty through sharing and providing value through great original content.
