# Anionu

![Anionu Logo](anionu-logo-120.png "Anionu Logo"){: .align-left} In 2010, Sourcey acquired private funding to build a surveillance system for the new generation of Internet technology. Today, Anionu is a solution to both personal and property security which has the potential change the industry. This document transparency addresses some key points regarding Anionu for both investors and customers.

## What is Anionu?
Anionu, pronounced "an-eye-on-you", is a video surveillance web application for savy home owners, business owners and security companies. 

## What makes Anionu unique?
The concept of remote video surveillance has been around for a while, but finally there is a modern alternative that people can fall in love with. Anionu’s elegant and intuitive interface will be especially appealing to those who enjoy using Apple products and engaging social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus.

Anionu allows users to manage a global network of cameras in real-time from a central browser-based application, and receive security notifications via SMS, email or Twitter. 

The web application makes full use of modern internet technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and WebRTC, and is designed to be easy to use for beginners, while providing plenty of advanced features for advanced users. 

Anionu has been heavily influenced by the open source movement, and features a full developer SDK with C++ and REST APIs for developers to improve and customize the service.

## What is the customer need, and what problems does it solve?
People want to know their loved ones and assets are protected, wherever they may be in the world. Anionu is providing peace of mind and a practical solution to an essential human need by bringing this technology to people in a way that easily adoptable, flexible and understandable.

## What is the solution and value proposition?
Anionu helps you to protect the people, places and things you care about using your existing computer and mobile phone technology.

Anionu is making video surveillance a viable option for every home and business owner by effectively removing the need for expensive and bulky DVR and CCTV technology.

## What are the risks, and how are they addressed?
The main risks for Anionu lie in scalability, cloud security, and QoS for international customers. 

### Scalability
The main scalability provision is for our ICE deployments which host resource-heavy TURN and STUN servers necessary for WebRTC, as well as our own custom signalling video streaming engine, <a href="http://sourcey.com/symple" title="Messaging made Symple">Symple</a>.

By using automated cloud instances we can dynamically scale and deploy on demand.

We build and maintain our own custom server architecture using <a href="http://sourcey.com/libsourcey" title="C++ Networking Evolved">LibSourcey</a> in order to better measure, control and monitor all aspects of our server deployments.

### Cloud Security
All user content such as surveillance footage and logs are stored off-site using Amazon S3. Best practices are employed for securing user passwords, which are encrypted with SHA-512 hash using bcrypt. All client requests to anionu.com use SSL encryption and CA verification to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks. Other measures such as enterprise level heuristics, firewalls, honeypots and DoS protection are used to protect and monitor servers.

### Quality of Service
In order for Anionu to provide reasonable quality of service for international customers, cloud infrastructure must be spread across multiple continents, initially focusing on presence in Australasia, the Americas and Asia.

## Could Anionu be copied by competitors?
Anionu is more than just a “good idea” brought to life with a fancy homepage, it is the result of years of dedicated research and development into the field of video surveillance. This groundwork is evident in our fully featured web application and accompanying native desktop application, and strengthened by the C++ SDK, C++ Plugin API, REST API, and a growing open source code base which will enable developers to extend and interoperate with Anionu in new and creative ways.

## Can I invest in Anionu?
Anionu is currently open to Angel investors who want to get in early to see this groundbreaking technology reach it's full global potential.

## Can I work at Anionu?
Anionu will be hiring extra developers and support staff before going public. If you're interested in working at an amazing startup that supports creativity and innovation with new web technologies then send your resume to <a href="mailto:info@anionu.com">info@anionu.com</a>

<!--
At it's core Anionu is a cloud-based surveillance service, but with a difference: 
No DVRs or specialised CCTV hardware is required; just your computer, mobile phone, and cameras (webcams and CCTV cameras are all compatible).
This means that literally anyone can setup a surveillance system to protect their home and business in just a few minutes, for very little money.
This is a very exciting prospect, and a great use for the Internet - which is now so readily accessible via the smart devices that we use every day.

Building cross-platform software is fraught with challenges, compatibility issues and restrictions imposed by the systems we work with.

We are happy to announce that that there is an alternative.

It is low cost; you can use it with any kind of camera; there are evil contracts or hidden extra costs; and setup only takes a minute.       
Oh, and best of all it is run by a small firm that know the business inside out and keep your best interests at heart.
