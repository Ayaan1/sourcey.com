<center><p>We release most of our code as open source for the purpose of strengthening the open source initiative that benefits us so much. Software is not only our passion, it is also our bread and butter. If you intend on using our code, especially in closed source or commercial applications, then we can provide you with an "optional" professional licence which is obtained with a very resonable one time payment. </p>

<p>As well as the satisfaction that you are supporting quality open source software, we will give you exposure through our blog and social media channels, providing that your company/product is consistent with our own ethics and objectives.</p>
