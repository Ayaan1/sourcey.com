Proper training in all aspects of the self is necessary lest you are swept away in a sea of hungry competition, at the bottom of which the charred remains of many lie - [approximately 8 out of 10](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericwagner/2013/09/12/five-reasons-8-out-of-10-businesses-fail/) to be morbidly generic.

Although the thoughts and ideas which drive creation on the Internet spring from the mind and fingertips, the act of strengthening the body and spirit is also essential not only to our survival, but overall mastery and state of mind. Weather we like to admit it or not, now, more than ever, we are living in a Darwinian world. v
 

### Mind

Feed your mind as a fat man gorges at a feast, feed it with books and good conversation so that it may question and grow, devouring everything of substance in it's wake.

Take your mind on journeys unrelated to your intended destination, branch far and wide so that you may frequently taste the surprise of new discovery which fuels the passion and desire to create.

Remember though, to be discerning, for your mind is a mirror, and the world is a distraction. Therefore, let your education be that which you would see in and of yourself. 

Theory is a wonderful thing, with theory we can sit comfortably and ponder the meaning of things. We can learn much from theory, but it doesn't prepare one for the game of life, where only empirical knowledge holds sway.

As you master mind, your perception and paradigm changes until you see no objects, just the very nature of things as they exist.

### Spirit

Spirit is the least easy to define, yet we feel it's presence flowing through and around us. When talking of spirit, it's important to refrain from terminology with abstract or mystical connotations such as 'qi', since mystical explanations usually only attempt to mask our ignorance.

Spirit is the charge within us, the impulse to action. It comes in many forms and hues, both hard and soft, and should be cultivated and expelled frequently.
To cultivate spirit, one should engage in conscious, focused exercise that promotes moving with the natural energy of the body.

As we spend more time at desks and in front of computer screens, the practice of cultivating spirit is even more essential than ever.

### Body

Let's leave behind, for a second, the concept of strength that we learn from an early age; the one that says that the bigger the muscle the better, and the one that tells us we need to react and fight against force. What is there was a different way of using the body that meant we could exert a huge amount of force without much effort? If you're willing to accept that, then read on ...

It's a scientifically proven fact that a relaxed muscle can withstand at least 3 times as much force as a tense muscle, so it shouldn't be too much of a stretch to imaging a scenario in which the concept of relaxation would be beneficial to the bodies ability to generate force. 
The simple fact is, most people are unable to stay relaxed under load, and I'm not talking about Bob Marley relaxed, I'm talking total relaxation and control of the muscles in the body to the point that oncoming force (to a point of course) doesn't affect the state of the body. This might sound far fetched, but it is in fact very real, and a different way with which to understand how the body operates.

The reason that the body is unable to stay relaxed when force is applied is because of the support structure, or more directly, the way we stand. By correctly aligning the skeletal structure to provide proper support, the muscles of the body, especially the deeper ones, can turn off, and the body will start to operate together as a whole, rather than a state of perpetual disconnection because of all the opposing muscles working against our movement.

To stand properly one should stand with a straight spine and neck, and knees slightly bent, hips relaxed and the coxyx rotated slightly under.

## Path of Least Resistance

As water trickles past rocks in a stream, so should the inexorable forward progress of your venture. The molecular structure of water is such that it man easily change course (explain), unlike the seemingly random and jagged way in which events disrupt our course in the real world. 

The best we really do in real life is to optimise and automate our workflows in order to reduce the likelyhood of problem or error. If you're building websites, then this might mean using something like Grunt or Capistrano, or if you're managing people then hopefully you inspire them, or it's going to be an uphill battle.

By constantly optimising your workflow you won't get bogged down in details because its too hard to focus on the bigger picture.
Your aim is to build as quick as possible so you can see the bigger picture come together - that's not to say things won't be difficulty, but at least you'll approach things from the right frame or reference.
