# 5 Tips To Optimize for SEO 2.0 in 2014

The phrase "Web 2.0" coined by Darcy DiNucci back in 1999 to describe web sites that use technology beyond the static pages of earlier web sites. In late 2004 the term was popularized by Tim O'Reilly at the O'Reilly Media Web 2.0 conference. Today, the changes to Google's algorithms have given rise to a new term in the SEO world; "SEO 2.0".

SEO 2.0 is different because the black-hat SEO techniques that worked in the past are no longer an option, unless you desperately want to get your site blacklisted by Google. The new internet is about people, and if Google can find a genuine way to reward integrity and reduce spam, then I'm all for it.

Now that the SEO paradigm has changed, we need to rethink our strategies in 2014. Here are a few key points that you should consider:

  <li>
  ### Keep a blog on your company domain

  ### Generate social signals and share your content

  ### Optimize your website
  Page speed and cross device optimization is more important than you think, and it also affects your SEO and rankings. Check out the Google Webmaster tools for an analysis of your website and advice on how to optimize it. If your site analysis ranks poorly then there's a fair change your site is being penalized.

  ### People
  The new SEO rewards human interaction over creating the greatest SEO link campaign known to man. If you're still trying to do this then maybe you need to rethink what it is you actually stand for. Make friends on the internet and you will be rewarded. The more your potential customers engage on the Internet, the more important it is for you to make friends and foster loyalty through sharing and providing value through great original content.
