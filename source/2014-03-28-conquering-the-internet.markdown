# Conquering the Internet

![Miyamoto Musashi](/conquering-the-internet/miyamoto-musashi.jpg "Miyamoto Musashi")

Everyone with an entrepreneurial spark is trying to claim their piece of Internet glory, yet only a small number will have any measure of success. 

Take, for example, the warlord. When a warlord conquers a country, he not only does so with supreme force of will, he does so with an army. Despite his brutality, the warlord's actions are for the most part, honourable, which is more than can be said for many modern day Internet warriors. The key difference between the Internet and the battlefield is anonymity, and hence the enormous potential for cloak and dagger.

In this brave new world of Internet marketing, it's the outspoken Internet warrior who stands out from the crowd with passion and conviction who's the real victor.

To conquer the Internet is a dream held by many, yet its easy to forget what's important along the treacherous path to victory.

and build unrealistic expectations of success.

## Meditation

Before setting out on any [new venture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth), it's vital you detach yourself from your quest and prepare your mind for what's coming. Only through focused meditation can you realise the calmness and clarity of mind necessary to view your venture with critical and honest objectivity.

The state of mind achieved through proper meditation gives one a spatial frame of reference with which to view concepts and ideas, and iwithin this spatial awareness all lateral thought becomes possible. 

Always attempt to break the constructs that bind your mind. In programming we have loops and scopes which serve to control and restrict the flow of data, and the mind works in much the same way. However, unlike programming, it's extremely difficult to understand the implications of our own patterning from behind the smokescreen, and far more difficult still to affect the kind of change necessary to shift the paradigm of consciousness with which we view reality.

and view your goals with an objective and critical mind.Â Ask yourself the difficult questions, and if you can't be 100% honest, then find someone who will be.

In the beginning it's important now to be blinded by entrepreneurial fervour, or loose sight of the reality of your choices. Make sure you know what you're getting yourself into, and that you're willing to accept the long term effects and responsibilities of your undertaking. 

, so ask the hard questions:
Take care not to fall into the trap of saying "We'll think about that when we come to it", for that's the path to ruin! 
but it can blind you to the tru nature of things

Beware also of blind entrepreneurial passion, for although it will be the driving force of your success, if unchecked it will drive you from the path of reason straight into the abyss quicker than you can say "But I thought...". 

During your meditations be sure to the hard questions:

* Have I researched the market properly?
* Do I have the manpower and resources?
* Is my project worthy of financial investment?
* Am I ready to spend the next few years doing this?
* Have I spoken to the right people?

In this world full by quick fix pop culture and black-hat morals, genuine quality has become something of a rarity. What's rare is also valuable, so stay true to your purpose and don't be guiled by the hollow promises and hype. Eventually you will prosper a real following, and though your success may not be be instantaneous, it will be well earned and rewarded. 

## Building Your Castle

Brace yourself, for this is often the most trying time for any venture, but also take heart in the knowledge that if done right then joyous times lay ahead. 

In the game of the Internet, you should first concentrate on building your castle. By castle, I am referring to your primary domain, which will be your primary real estate.

Be sure not to spread yourself thin with too many towns and villages early on in the piece. Consolidate your resources and majestify your castle so that people will gather from far and wide to witness the spectacle. When your economy begins to flourish you will be able to direct the flow of trade as you like, and expansion will happen naturally.

## Rallying the Troops

<!--

In order to realise your vision, you will need to rally elite troops to your side - unless of course you intend to be a one man army ie. a solopreneur and a total masochist. 

The Internet is a hive of people, and everyone is looking for something, so be sure to understand the tools at your disposal and use them to connect with the right people. Check your local area for meetups, pitches and conferences. Remember also that no amount of well written emails can substitute being a pro-active member of a community. Some good places are Meetup, Facebook, and Github.

Talk about your ideas with as many people as possible, raise the necessary funding, and pretty soon your passion and conviction will attract the army you need.

To consolidate your vision, you will need to rally the troops. Working as a solopreneur is a tough gig - so why not make life easy on yourself? The Internet is a hive of people, and everyone is looking for something, so why not use it to connect with people! Check meetup.com for local meetups with people of similar interests. Talk about and develop your ideas with other people, and pretty soon your talent, conviction and passion will begin to attract an army.

## Going to War

On the Internet success is measured in terms of conversions, revenue and real estate. Total annihilation of the competition is just a bonus.

Developing a sound marketing strategy and sticking to is key, as well as knowing how to use the Internet as a weapon.

Without going into extreme detail, here are some factors to consider when planning and implementing your strategy.

### Content

Google's algorithm changes have made it easier than ever to rank for genuine quality original content, so get writing! Write natural content covering all aspects of your market and profession. Careful not to repost or duplicate your content on other sites. Guest post if you have to, but remember, **your** content is always more valuable on **YOUR** domain.

Because of this, it follows that you should store your blog of your own domain. Try to stay clear of cloud blogging platforms (Wordpress/Tumblr) to host your primary content (unless you use your own domain), but by all means use them to aggregate excerpts from your blog feed.

### Social Media

Social media mastery is vital to your online success. Learn to balance the right amount of interaction and automation to ensure rapid growth. 

Using and understanding the right tools for the job will save you precious time. Tools you should be using are: <a href="http://bufferapp.com" title="Buffer" target="_blank">Buffer</a> to automate your content syndication, and <a href="http://gardn.net" title="Gardn" target="_blank">Gardn</a> to ensure your content is shared far and wide via your social networks.

### SEO

Things are changing fast in the SEO world, so it's a good idea to stay informed about the latest SEO trends without getting caught up in the hype.

Spend some time creating regular content and reputable backlinks, and be sure to optimise your site for page speed and cross platform devices. Forget about the crappy minisites and backlink spam - shortcuts will get you killed. 

Educate yourself about static websites if appropriate (Middleman, Jekyll), responsive design (Bootstrap, Zerb Foundation), and use pretty URLs wherever possible.

### Advertising

Your best source of traffic is going to be organic search traffic, so pool your resources and focus on the search engines. If you have the budget for it,Â then by all means advertise the best of your content and products.

PPC advertising is expensive, and can be hit and miss depending on your product and presentation. The best success I have had is with more expensive items due to the increased the conversion ratio.

You might also consider paid directories. DMOZ is free but hard to get in, and Best of the Web and Yahoo are well known paid directories. Directories will give you credibility, but bear in mind they aren't cheap, and many consider them to be redundant.

## Preparing for Victory

The victor has certain obligations, least of which is to set the standard for those to come.

The victor has certain obligations in the eyes of the many, and the way victory is handled says a lot for the character of a individual or business. It's easy to be overwhelmed by the bright lights and fat stacks, so try to free yourself from gloating and arrogant expression. The greatest reward is to succeed and grow rich while having a great time and conducting yourself with impeccable integrity.

As your business grows, so must you. Be consistent with your training, meditation and relaxation, and keep developing your mind and body so that your endeavours may evolve alongside your vision of abundant creativity.
