# The Art of the Internet AKA. Attack of the Clones

Many of the programmers and designers I know consider themselves to be artists, but as in the art world, there are good artists, and well ... not so good artists. 

Pretty much anyone can be a builder, but not everyone can be an artist. It's important to realise that artists are not just people who build stuff, they are able to channel real creative inspiration and express it using their medium. 

True artists are few and far between in the professional IT world, probably due to the logic driven paradigm in which we work. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and scientests say this is related to their predominant functional lateralisation ie. weather they predominantly use the right (intuitive) and the left(logical) hemispheres of their brain. A person who is "left-brained" is often said to be more logical, analytical, and objective, while a person who is "right-brained" is said to be more intuitive, thoughtful, and subjective.

Given this basis, it would be safe to assume that the Internet is a very "left-brained" phenomenon. The problem here, is that left brained thinking is fundamentally restrictive; it is calculated, rigid, and lacks abstract dimension. Despite this however, even fundamentally "left-brained" thinkers can appreciate fine art. They might not completely understand it, and their conscious brain is probably full of questions like "how long it took to paint" and "how much is it worth", but it still speaks to them on a primal, subconscious level. This is the kind of psychological connection you should be making when you design our next project. Every day I see new startups being released, and I look at their websites and I see clones of whatever design is trending. How many other people out there must be in the same boat (especially in the tech industry), how many of their potential customers!? 

It's time to look deeper folks, I don't believe that we can't balance our logical and intuitive brains to compliment eachother - in fact I believe it's the mark of genius when it can be achieved. The more clones that saturate the internet and media worldwide, the more people will be recognize that point-of-difference that makes them feel something. I recommend that all you IT professionals master your trade thoroughly before expecting success, and also mingle with real artists to learn how they think. Unless you have it natural, artists are the ones that will teach you to create with with passion and inspiration. Think like an artist and work like a machine!
