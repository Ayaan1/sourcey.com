# The Art of the Internet AKA. Attack of the Clones

Many of the programmers and designers I know consider themselves to be artists, but as in the art world, there are good artists, and well ... not so good artists. 

It's important to realise that artists are not just people who build stuff, they are able to channel real creative inspiration and express it using their medium. How many so called 'entrepreneurs' or 'gurus' can claim this? Most are just churning out the same old stale crap. Remember people, its easy to be a builder, but not many people can be an artist. 

The truth is artists (and women to a lesser extent *slap*) are few and far between in the professional IT world, but thats most likely due to the logic driven paradigm in which we work. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses; and some say this is related to their predominant functional lateralisation ie. weather they predominantly use the right (intuitive) and the left(logical) hemispheres of their brain. A person who is "left-brained" is often said to be more logical, analytical, and objective, while a person who is "right-brained" is said to be more intuitive, thoughtful, and subjective. Personally, I believe this concept to be a total myth, but people's tendency to believe in absurd ideas that adequately describe the unknown should never be underestimated!

Lets say for arguments sake that functional lateralisation was a real thing, then it would be safe to assume that the Internet is a predominantly "left-brained" phenomenon. The problem here, is that left brained thinking is fundamentally restrictive; it's calculated, rigid, and lacks abstract dimension. Despite this however, even "left-brained" thinkers have the ability to appreciate fine art. They might not truly understand it, but it still speaks to them on a primal level, which tells me the ability is there, but the connection has been lost.

Every day I look at new startups being released, and its rare that I don't look at their websites and see a clone of whatever design is currently trending. It's almost like sitting through a Hollywood movie; the formulaic predictability detracts from any substance that might be lurking beneath the surface. How many other people out there must be in the same boat, especially in gen Y, how many potential customers!? 

It's time to look deeper folks. It's time to let our logical and intuitive brains compliment each other, in fact this kind of genius thats within all of our grasp. The more clones that saturate the Internet and media worldwide, the more people will be recognize the genuine point-of-difference that makes them feel something. Try to make a genuine psychological and emotional connection with your clients when planning your next project, and if they ain't feelin' it like you are, then your idea might not be as good as you think.

To all of you IT professionals out there, take the time to thoroughly master your trade before expecting success, and don't forget to mingle with real artists because they will teach you to create with passion and inspiration. Think like an artist and work like a machine!
